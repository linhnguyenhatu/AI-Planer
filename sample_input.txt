Can you help with generating a 7-day travel plan for a party of 5? We're setting off from Indianapolis and planning to explore 3 cities in Colorado from March 11th to March 17th, 2022. We have a budget of $15,100 for this trip. We'll be bringing our pets, so pet-friendly accommodations are a must. We're also hoping to find places that offer Mexican, Italian, Mediterranean, and Indian cuisines. Entire rooms for accommodations would be ideal.
